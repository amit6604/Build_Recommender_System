Recommendation Systems are a type of **information filtering systems** as they improve the quality of search results and provides items that are more relevant to the search item or are realted to the search history of the user.  \n",
        "\n",
        "They are used to predict the **rating** or **preference** that a user would give to an item. Almost every major tech company has applied them in some form or the other: Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers, YouTube uses it to decide which video to play next on autoplay, and Facebook uses it to recommend pages to like and people to follow. \n",
        "Moreover,  companies like Netflix and Spotify  depend highly on the effectiveness of their recommendation engines for their business and sucees.\n",

The System recommends the same movies to users with similar demographic features. Since each user is different , this approach is considered to be too simple. The basic idea behind this system is that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience.\n",

This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.\n",
